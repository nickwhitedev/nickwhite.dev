        <h1>Why This Site?</h1>
        <p>This page is a collection of motivations, inspirations, tools, and resources I've found helpful in building
          this site.</p>
        <p>As the site grows, this page should grow with it, so I'll just put what I can remember here and add to it
          over time.</p>

        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        <p>I wanted to build this particular website because I didn't have a place to send people that was specific to
          my software engineer identity.</p>
        <p>What is my software engineer identity?</p>
        <p>I'm still trying to understand it myself, but it's starting to manifest as a minimalistic, quality-focused,
          web developer who wants to engage more with like-minded devs.</p>
        <p>What motivated me to build a website from scratch?</p>
        <p>
          I have spent so much time learning and working with frontend frameworks, backend frameworks, and cloud hosting
          platforms.
          Building a website from scratch with the least amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript then hosting it with a
          simple setup on a small server seemed like a fun challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I have a website built with only code that I've written myself, I feel like I have more control over
          it than normal.
        </p>
        <p>Endless potential!</p>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a></strong></strong> - I started with the
            smallest VPS I could and as of writing this, it's having no trouble serving what little I have to the few
            who visit it.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a></strong> - Caddy is the HTTP server I went with. I
            like its simple Caddyfile configuration format.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/nickwhitedev/nickwhite.dev/">GitHub</a></strong> - Version control
            makes everything better. My git repository for this site is on GitHub and I'm using GitHub Actions to deploy
            the site when I push to the main branch.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></strong> - I'm currently using VS Code as my
            code editor. It's snappy, has a lot of good extensions, and works well as an IDE.</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="https://plainvanillaweb.com/">Plain Vanilla</a></strong> - As mentioned above, I drew a
            lot of inspiration from Joeri's guide to web development from scratch. I referenced the Plain Vanilla guide
            many times while building this website.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://modernfontstacks.com/">Modern Font Stacks</a></strong> - A collection of font
            rules that leverage standard built-in fonts. This is a simple and creative way to eliminate the need for
            third party fonts.</li>
          <li><strong><a
                href="https://github.com/apenasDaniel/vps-github-actions-auto-deploy">vps-github-actions-auto-deploy</a></strong>
            - A short guide for setting up automated deployment with GitHub Actions. I <a
              href="https://github.com/nickwhitedev/vps-github-actions-auto-deploy">forked</a> the repository and added
            my changes to document my process.
          </li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://dominikhofer.me/setup-secure-vps">But, how do I actually set up and secure a new
                VPS (on Hetzner)?</a></strong> - Based on this <a href="https://youtu.be/Q1Y_g0wMwww">video</a>, Dominik
            Hofer wrote a quick guide on how to set up a secure VPS from the start.</li>
          <li><strong><a
                href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development">Trunk-based
                development</a></strong> - Atlassian's article on trunk-based development describes the git workflow
            I've landed on. I initially started with <a
              href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">Gitflow</a> because
            I've used that in the past for corporate projects but that proved to be too heavy-handed for my little site
            with one
            contributor.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>That's It!</h2>
        <p>At least, that's all I can think of for now.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
